TO DO:

DONE - get player profile links working on production site
REDID ENTIRE SCORESHEET INSTEAD - (can't edit scores in mobile view, they just revert automatically) refreshing when scoresheet is in mobile view deletes jokers?
REDID ENTIRE SCORESHEET INSTEAD - Need to double click sorting columns for them to work the first time?
REDID ENTIRE SCORESHEET INSTEAD - reordering the columns on the scoresheet deletes all scores (set colReorder to true in the datatables initialization to see this)
DONE/REDID ENTIRE SCORESHEET INSTEAD - Add a select/button to load an old scoresheet.
DONE - Automatically fill out joker for historical rounds
DONE - add player profile links to the scoresheet
DONE - total column is using wrong creator bonus rows (see may 05 2023)
DONE - Make round names editable?
DONE - change dropdown to sort dates and auto select newest date
DONE - implement add player functionality
DONE - Change the default players to display
DONE - sorting isn't working right on the scoresheet (see may 05 2023)
DONE - Fix Dan/dad and Debi/mom creator bug
DONE - added cooperative button and category dropdowns, Add max score/replay info to scoresheet,
DONE - set coop, category status on load if they are already set (for historical rounds)
DONE - after editing round name, creator cell highlighting is lost (but creator score unchanged) (also, need to make sure we can set the creator for a round manually in case it doesn't work on load)
DONE - need to handle creator bonus when a player made multiple rounds in one night (See May 12 2023)
DONE - (also - changing round name saves a new round in the database, and doesn't delete the old one, maybe need to check the round index and overwrite that way?) (Probably same problem with changing the creator)
DONE - Add save functionality
DONE - Need a way to add or remove a column
DONE - Scores are not updated if a player's score for a round is deleted and not replaced in the scoresheet
DONE - Style dropdowns, delete buttons, overall table
DONE - on round name change, jokers are lost (because scores variable is not updated, the round name does not exist in the scores variable)
DONE - zero score is not saved
DONE - add new player is broken
DONE - The joker rounds switch to blank (instead of select) if you switch from a date where there are jokers set (may 5 2023) to one where they are not (feb 17 2023)
DONE - Can we make the scoresheet expand and contract when we change the window size?
DONE - need to save joker_round_indices in the database on save
DONE - When we create/delete rounds and players, we also need to update the presentations table
DONE - handling of mobile view (probably just another dropdown to select a single column + total score to view?)
DONE - fix button font
DONE - Enter player background is white in website view
DONE - save button broken in web view, also add round (what about delete?)
DONE - getting a lot of 403 forbidden which may explain some of the above (at least the last one)
DONE - Round names are not correctly changing when we change the date in website view
DONE - Select dropdowns are horizontally aligned in website view, not vertical
DONE - cut the number of sig figs being displayed in the table (see 3.17.2023)
DONE - clicking today repeatedly screws things up
DONE - seems like something in the presentations db is getting screwed up (wrong presentation row is being modified, could have to do with today button?)
DONE - pip install django-cors-headers on server, material ui?
DONE - Add a new page where you can make a presentation.
DONE - Add a round ideas page connected to ChatGPT API for quickly getting ideas for new rounds
DONE - Trivia Round Maker - enter ten questions and answers, select a theme from a dropdown, and it will generate a round for you.
DONE - still losing jokers on refresh - probably has to do with when we use the today button
DONE - have round title text size alter after we change a round name
DONE - scoresheet lost connection to database? - failed to fetch api_token_auth in console (it's looking for localhost:8000)
DONE - css on the presentation page and SWOOP
DONE - make the rounds list table extend to the bottom of the page
DONE - Automatically get links to new rounds.
DONE - need to handle really long round names (make the font smaller?), seemed like this was breaking the script to update slide 2
DONE - add footer?
DONE - add zeros to the created round category counts if the creator hasn't made any rounds in that category
DONE - install pyautogen on server
DONE - top item in rounds_list still screws up on mobile, and make COOP checkbox bigger.
DONE - on analysis page, nones in the max score (if nothing is entered in scoresheet) is breaking the page - default to 10??
DONE - deleting a player from the scoresheet kills the jokers??? (maybe around line 668 in App.js?)
DONE - Check for dad/dan and debi/mom in the old scoresheets, this is leading to missing dad's scores for some rounds
DONE - Add historical presentations to the presentations table (with joker info)
DONE - add a console "are you sure" when editing a previous date
DONE - fix swooper images by condensing the round prompt before feeding it into dalle
DONE - Try using autogen api - could give the players a single question/answer that is fact-checked and interesting (could benchmark GPT 3.5 v 4 v autogen?)
DONE - on server, python -m pip install Pillow"
DONE - Customizable player profile (pic, about)
DONE - analysis page footer is messed up
DONE - if joker and creator round match, fix the scoring (6/9/2022? - Jenny)
DONE - single quotes in round titles breaks the JSON, see line 639 in App.js (now ~~~~)
NOT A PROBLEM (fixed regex) - If there is no text on the title slide, we need a way to fail silently and move on
NOT A PROBLEM (fixed regex) - and update_merged_presentation appears to be erroring (fails after the round is marked as read though), and not updating presentations or rounds table
DONE - fix font sizes, double adding new rounds to existing pres
DONE - fix presentation date in mail.py currently is date + 1day
DONE  - pip install channels
DONE - pip install channels-redis
DONE - pip install uvicorn
DONE - pip install uvicorn[standard]
DONE - brew install redis

TEST - make sure everyone has permission to access the presentation - set general access to anyone with the link when creating the presentation
TEST FIX - Figure out why the production site's generate button is timing out (in under 30 seconds or so). - and why is the date wrong?? one day later than it should be (Could be a timezone issue)
    NOTE: I changed the timeout setting for the workers in gunicorn.conf.py to 300, or 5 minutes





TRIVIAL (minutes)

TODO - fix the URL for links to rounds in mail.py (create_presentation and updated_merged_presentation), want the permissions to be anyone with link (this error affects viewing the slides (403) and apparently updating presentations, which only works on Alex account?), and URL to be view, not edit
TODO - add "link" input to scoresheet, to allow display and manual entry of link to a specific round if it was not added through the generate/update buttons
TODO - remove any hardcoded passwords or api keys

High - it's possible to end up with multiple presentations for the same day by repeatedly adding and deleting a single round from the scoresheet (screws up jokers)
High - add normalize option to the rounds list


MEDIUM (1-2 hrs)

TODO - fix the scoresheet to save on every change made.
TODO - save_scores, delete round, create round need to broadcast changes via channels

High - add sorting to the player round/rounds list page, also want to be able to see the lowest high score on a round.
High - add a link to the rounds list page on the round category counts that filters by rounds that person has created with that category
Medium - could redo mobile CSS for scoresheet to show all rounds for one player, then they could enter their scores for each round, and the button would switch the player.
Medium - General CSS tweaking, mainly for mobile view (scoresheet esp.)
Low - Weird stuff like if you joker two different rounds (Zach, 9/1/2022), or if a round has two different creators...



LARGE (2-8hrs)


High - Add the prediction models back to the scoresheet (try joint conditioning on both player and category) (and the blog?)
High - Be able to specify what position to put new rounds, instead of appending to end of presentation, add interface to select unused rounds from email (or old rounds?). Show the number of submitted rounds/who has submitted a round for the current week on the home page.
High - Finish the stats for the analysis page ("Player" options) / possibly add the player specific stuff to the profile pages. NORMALIZE SCORES before computing stats
Medium - If we add a new player on the scoresheet, we need to modify the GPTriviaround model to accept additional players and save their scores too.
Medium - add a creator name input to SWOOP, somehow pass that to create presentation functionality (one option - save the round in the database as it is submitted, not after presentation is created)
Medium - Add an option to view a previous week's presentation on the home page.



HUGE (>8 hrs)

Medium - Add page where you can write your answers, and use gpt for automatic scoring on submit.
Low - Minigames/polls? such as a timed quiz using previous questions from other creators (could use gpt to identify questions on slides and pull them in for stats/use them as inspiration for minigame questions)
Low - Have GPT-V read in all questions and answers from past slides and put them into database, along with the question-level data indicating whether players got the right answer.
