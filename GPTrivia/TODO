Low - Need to double click sorting columns for them to work the first time?

MEDIUM (1-2 hrs)

High - Finish the stats for the analysis page ("Player" options) / possible add the player specific stuff to the profile pages. NORMALIZE SCORES before computing stats

LARGE (2-8hrs)

High - make the site mobile friendly. (Menu, tables, slides, etc)

High - Add a round ideas page connected to ChatGPT API for quickly getting ideas for new rounds
