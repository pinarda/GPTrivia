TO DO:

TRIVIAL (minutes)

TODO TEST - make sure everyone has permission to access the presentation - set general access to anyone with the link when creating the presentation

High - add normalize option to the rounds list
High - add zeros to the created round category counts if the creator hasn't made any rounds in that category
High - Can we make the scoresheet expand and contract when we change the window size?
Medium - Show the number of submitted rounds/who has submitted a round for the current week on the home page.
Low - Need to double click sorting columns for them to work the first time?

MEDIUM (1-2 hrs)

TODO - Figure out why the production site's generate button is timing out (in under 30 seconds or so).
TODO - If there is no text on the title slide, we need a way to add the name to the 2nd slide and the scoresheet
TODO - need to handle really long round names (make the font smaller?), seemed like this was breaking the script to update slide 2
TODO - Check for dad/dan and debi/mom in the scoresheet, this is leading to missing dad's scores for some rounds
TODO - Add round type/max score/replay info to scoresheet, and spots to manually enter the round categories, and automatically get links to new rounds.
TODO - (can't edit scores in mobile view, they just revert automatically) refreshing when scoresheet is in mobile view deletes jokers?

High - add sorting to the player round page, also want to be able to see the lowest high score on a round.
High - add a link to the rounds list page on the round category counts that filters by rounds that person has created with that category
High - add a new page where you can make a presentation.
High - Finish the stats for the analysis page ("Player" options) / possible add the player specific stuff to the profile pages. NORMALIZE SCORES before computing stats
High - Add an option to autofill any remaining round slots with old rounds from an unused creator, or a second round from a creator.
       Also, a button to make an entirely new presentation with reused rounds (using Hail Science Remix template)
Medium - Add a select/button to load an old scoresheet.
Medium - Customizable player profile (pic, about)
Medium - reordering the columns on the scoresheet deletes all scores (set colReorder to true in the datatables initialization to see this)



LARGE (2-8hrs)

High - Be able to specify what position to put new rounds, instead of appending to end of presentation
High - Add a round ideas page connected to ChatGPT API for quickly getting ideas for new rounds
Medium - If we add a new player on the scoresheet, we need to modify the GPTriviaround model to accept additional players and save their scores too.
Medium - Add the prediction models back to the scoresheet (try joint conditioning on both player and category)


HUGE (>8 hrs)

Low - Minigames/polls? such as a timed quiz using previous questions from other creators
Low - Incorporate the question-level data from the forms
